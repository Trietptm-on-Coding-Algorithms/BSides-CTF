# Never Too Late Mister

### Challenge Description

My friend John is an environmental activist and a humanitarian. He really hated the ideology of Thanos from the Avengers: Infinity War. He sucks at programming. He used too many variables while writing any program. One day, John gave me a memory dump and asked me to find out what he was doing while he took the dump. Can you figure it out for me?
